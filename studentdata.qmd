## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
studentdata <- read.table("C:/Users/lenovo/Desktop/Student_Dataset_Assignment.txt",header=TRUE,sep="\t",quote="\"")
head(studentdata)
data(CO2)
dt<-data.frame(CO2)
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc, y = uptake, color = Treatment)) +geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE)+labs(title = "CO₂ conc~ uptake",x = "CO₂conc (mL/L)",y = "CO₂uptake (μmol/m²·s)",color = "Treatment" ) +theme_minimal()
##As CO₂ concentration increases, the plant's CO₂ uptake rate also rises. The treatment condition (whether chilled or not) affects uptake efficiency, indicating differences in the plant's adaptability to environmental conditions.
```
